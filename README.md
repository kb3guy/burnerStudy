Study on the thermodynamics of nozzles for the combustion of propane

This collection of Jupyter notebooks is intended to help in the analysis and design of propane burners for forges. It utilizes iPython widgets, so these need to be run somewhere other than github.

## Injector Flow.ipynb
This notebook looks at one-dimensional, Mach 1 flow through a metering orifice, and is a basis for understanding fuel injection.

## Cone Nozzle.ipynb
This notebook explores the design of a subsonic cone nozzle.

## Bell Nozzle.ipynb
This notebook is to be an exploration of bell nozzles contoured by the method of characteristics. It is far from complete.

## Combustion.ipynb
This notebook explores the chemistry of combustion and methods for combustion chamber (combustor) sizing.

## Burner Design.ipynb
This notebook will be for combining the understanding from all of the other notebooks into a cohesive system: fuel injectors, combustor, and outlet nozzle.
